## What we did: 
We used Firebase for most authentication as well as real-time database (general infomation), and Firebase storage (card and ID images). All user info is encrypted and infomation such as code can only accessed in that day. 

This prototypes have 2 versions for doctors and users respectively. 

## What we hope to improve in the future: 
- Enhance our blockchain to handle large amounts of data and to start introducing new key partners.
- Improve user interface of the app
- Make the QR Code for the digital and make it accessible.
